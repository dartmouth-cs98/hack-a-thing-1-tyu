## Description
I've never done web development before. Therefore, I wanted to create my own website portfolio. 

## Resources Used
LearnCode.academy's youtube tutorials on Web Development for Beginners

https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_round_buttons.asp

## Learned:
I learned the following:
- how to use VSCode
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- How to set up ssh keys in terminal with my github account
- Responsive Design



## What didn't work
I struggled to connect github directly to VSCode for the longest time. It kept not recognizing my remote repository and would take forever to try to commit anything. Eventually, I realized it was easier just to use regular commandline.
