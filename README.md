## Description
I've never done web development before. Therefore, I wanted to create my own website portfolio to include a little about me, my resume, and how to get in contact with me.

## Learned:
I learned the following:
- how to use VSCode
- VSCode plugins
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- How to set up ssh keys in terminal with my github account

- How to think about a website's design and layout
- Proper design, html, and css practice for web development
- using Developer Tools on websites



## What didn't work
I struggled to connect github directly to VSCode for the longest time. It kept not recognizing my remote repository and would take forever to try to commit anything. Eventually, I realized it was easier just to use the regular commandline. 

I had usses with github recognizing my account/profile when I tried to push things from the terminal. With the help of google, I was able to set up an ssh key between my github account and terminal. This then lead me to the issue of not being able to push my updates due to email privacy restrictions. However, after tweaking my github settings, I could finally push to github with my account.

I wouldn't say this didn't work, but it definitely took some time for me to figure out the best way to format things in css. All the different layout components became hard to track and manipulation of images was tougher than I expected. I wanted to create a cool gallery wall with images in hexagons, but found it much easier to just format the images to the way I wanted it and pasting the finished image into the website instead. In addition, having to consider responsive design was an added challenge. I could barely get the desktop screen to showcase what I wanted, but with time and more training I'm sure it'll get much easier. 

Generally, web development wasn't as hard as I had anticipated, and I hope to gain more exposure to it in the future. It definitely helps that there are lots of resources, guides, and tutorials out there for it.
